## Howdy! 

- I'm a quantitative population ecologist interesting in bridging theory and statistical ecology.
- My pronouns are he/him. I'm a queer guy working in ecology, and you can read about why that matters to me [here](https://plantae.org/a-queer-stroll-through-the-meadow/). 
- I'm originally from the northeast, and am a big fan of the forests of the northeast.
- You can learn more at my [personal website](https://jeremycollings.com/).
