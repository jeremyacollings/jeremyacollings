## Howdy! 

- I'm a quantitative population ecologist interested in bridging theory and statistical ecology.
- I love using Bayesian methods to fit population models and then make inference about population- and community-level processes. 
- I like all sorts of critters! I've mostly worked on plants and microbes, but have also dabbled in birds, mushrooms, and whelks.
- My pronouns are he/him. I'm a queer guy working in ecology, and you can read about why that matters to me [here](https://plantae.org/a-queer-stroll-through-the-meadow/).
- I'm originally from the northeast, and am a big fan of the forests of the northeast. I love all the pretty spring ephemerals and fall foliage.
